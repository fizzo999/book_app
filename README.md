## Overview

Problem domain: user is presented with a search input form. An input field to fill in for a book search by title or author (2 radio buttons - click one) and a submit button. Upon submitting the query gets captured and sent in the correct format to google books api. The return is again formatted correctly and then displayed in the browser on a new page using tamplating with ejs.

## Getting Started

Setup filestructure. Install libraries. Code out server.js by calling the libraries, defining the variables and creating the app, setting up the app to listen (on PORT 3000), setting up correct (RESTful) .get and .post routes. Setting up superagent request to correctly formatted google. formatting received data to send to frontend. Code out template to loop over dada Array. Style the input and the results page.

## Architecture

Using EJS templating engine and Express as a server framework plus dotenv to create a Javascript server application. Using superagent framework to make outbound server requests to google books api and handle feedback.
